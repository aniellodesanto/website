Source Files for the Outdex Blog
================================

This repository holds the source files for the Outdex blog.
They are simple markdown files that are automatically converted to HTML via [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/), a static website generator implemented in Python.
We use the `pandoc_reader` plugin to get access to the [pandoc dialect](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) instead of basic markdown.
Whenever a new commit is pushed to the repository, the source files are automatically converted and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Branches
--------

The repository uses the following branches:

- `master` holds the source files from which the public-facing part of outdex is built.
  Only administrators may push to `master`.
- `staging` is used for testing that new posts look correct before they're pushed out to master.
- `writing` is where the actual writing and editing takes place.
  Any new files should go here first, and progress from here to `staging`, then `master`.

Cloning the repository
----------------------

The themes folder contains our [custom fork](https://github.com/outde-xyz/Flex) of the [flex theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex).
The fork is not incorporated as a submodule, as this proved too much of a headache to manage correctly.
Yes, that's against best practices, but our fork of the theme changes so rarely that this isn't an issue in practice.
So just use `git clone` in the usual fashion, without worrying about submodules.


File Structure
--------------

Once you've cloned the repository, you'll see a couple of files and folders.
The most important ones are:

- `content`: the markdown files for the website
- `output`: the actual website generated by Pelican
- `pelicanconf.py`: contains various settings for site creation; do not change unless you know what you're doing
- `publishconf.py`: allows you to override certain settings in the final creation phase; do not change unless you know what you're doing
- `Makefile`: set of instructions for building the website

As an author, only `content` is of interest to you.

Workflow
--------

Creating a new post is easy.

1.  Make sure you are in the branch `writing`.
    ```
    git checkout writing
    ```
1.  Also check that your local copy of `writing` is up-to-date.
    ```
    git pull
    ```
1.  Go to the folder `content` and then the folder for the appropriate category (`Discussions`, `News`, or `Tutorials`).
1.  Create a new markdown file.
1.  Make sure the markdown file starts with a well-formed header with the first few lines consisting of
    - `Title:`,
    - `Author:`, (or `Authors:` if there's multiple; name should be comma-separated)
    - `Date:` (in format YYYY-MM-DD),
    - `Tags:` (comma-separated list),
    - finally, an empty line.
1.  Look at other posts in the repo for concrete examples.
1.  Once you are done writing, make a commit in the usual fashion:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "some description"
    git push origin writing
    ```
1.  If there are conflicts, resolve them before proceeding.
1.  Switch to `staging`, make sure it's up-to-date, then merge in `writing`.
    ```
    git checkout staging
    git pull
    git merge writing
    ```

The commit will trigger a rebuild of the `staging` branch on Netlify.
You can check the output at `https://staging.outdex.xyz`.
If everything looks good, file a pull request against `master`.
Once it gets merged in, Netlify will also rebuild the `master` branch and your post will be visible at `https://outde.xyz`.


System Requirements
-------------------

Outdex is now hosted on Netlify, which offers better build tools with automatic deployment.
So there is no longer any need for a local build environment, commits are automatically deployed by Netlify.
Even guest authors can use this: if they file a pull request, they automatically get a link to a Netlify preview.

The list below is largely for future reference in case the build environment needs to be recreated from scratch.

1.  Python 3.6 or higher.

1.  Pelican 4.0 or higher.
    
    - Linux users might already have it their repository.
    - On OSX and Windows (and Linux, if necessary) you can install Pelican via Python's package manager `pip` (but see the next section on how to use `pip` in a smarter way).

    ~~~~~
    pip install pelican
    ~~~~~

1.  The `ghp-import` script is no longer needed. 
    GitHub pages has been abandoned in favor of Netlify.
    If desired, you can install `gph-import` via pip

    ~~~~~
    pip install ghp-import
    ~~~~~

    or use your package manager if you're on Linux.

1.  A number of Python3 libraries:
    - `markdown`, version 3.0 or higher
    - `pygments`, version 2.3 or higher
    - `typogrify` library, version 2.0.7 or higher
    - *beautifulsoup4*, version 4.7 or higher; in Debian, the library is called `python3-bs4`

    As before, use pip or your package manager to install these dependencies.

1.  At least version 2.2 of `pandoc` and 0.14 of `pandoc-citeproc`.
    Linux users should definitely install those from their repositories.
    Everybody else is referred to [pandoc's install guide](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

1.  A recent-ish version of the `make` tool.
    This is usually already installed on Linux and OSX.
    If it isn't, make sure you have the basic tools for compiling software installed.
    On Debian and Ubuntu, the following should work:

    ~~~~
    sudo aptitutde install build-essential
    ~~~~

    On Windows, install [GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).
    The `make` binary also has to be in your PATH, which happens automatically on Linux and OSX but not Windows.
    

A Note on `pip` Installations
------------------------------

Python's `pip` has the nasty habit of scattering the install files across various system folders.
A better solution is to create a *virtual environment* in your home directory that holds all the files related to working with pelican:

~~~~~
mkdir ~/.outdex_env
virtualenv -p python3 ~/.outdex_env
~/.outdex_env/bin/pip3 install pelican ghp-import
~~~~~

You then have to make the pelican script accessible through your shell, either by adding `~/.outdex_env` to your PATH or by symlinking it to a folder in your PATH (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`).

If that sounds like too much of a hassle, install `pipsi`, which automatically creates and manages virtual environments.


Technical issues
----------------

The `pandoc_reader` plugin breaks Pelican's `{filename}`-hooks because of how pandoc versions after 1.15.0 mangle curly braces.
The version in our repo has a minor workaround to fix this.
In `pandoc_reader.py`, 


```python
return output, metadata
```

has been expanded to

```python
output = output.replace('%7Bfilename%7D','{filename}')
return output, metadata
```

We need to make sure that this fix is merged in whenever we update the plugin.


To Do
-----

- [x] set up email for submissions (hosted by Zoho)
- [ ] fix summary breaking math; should always end immediately after first paragraph
- [ ] maybe switch commenting system to `staticman`?
- [x] expand pandoc reader to handle Pelican's `{filename}`-hooks
- [ ] adapt filter for pandoc to automatically include tikz and forest code as svgs
- [ ] design pandoc filter for converting glossed examples to HTML tables
- [ ] Categories should not be treated as tags
- [ ] automatically convert posts to PDF and embed download link
- [x] create favicon from logo
