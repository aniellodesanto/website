This picture got mailed to me a while ago.
A Google search brings up [this Italian blog](https://italianol2emoltoaltro.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/2110/), but since there's no accompanying text I'm not sure if this is the actual source or just another repost (Facebook?).

Anyhoo, any suggestions for the computational and/or mathematical linguistics bees?
