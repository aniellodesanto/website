Want to contribute a post?
Great, it's easy!
Just email us your post as a text file: `submissions@outde.xyz`.
No pdfs please, it needs to be an editable file.
A plaintext file (e.g. `txt`) is best, but `tex`, `doc` and `docx` are acceptable if necessary.
As long as your submission is suitable for the outdex, we'll post it directly under your name.
No registration, no special software, just writing.

If you're tech-savvy and want to make our life a little easier, there's a few additional steps you can take.
Each one reduces our editorial workload by quite a bit, and we already have a series of blog posts that explain each step in detail.

1. Write your document in [markdown]({filename}/Tutorials/outdex_guide_writing.md).
1. Add the appropriate [metadata]({filename}/Tutorials/outdex_guide_yaml.md).
1. Submit your article as a [pull request]({filename}/Tutorials/outdex_guide_submitting.md).
